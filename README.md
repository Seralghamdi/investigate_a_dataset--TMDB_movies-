# investigate_a_dataset--TMDB_movies-
## Project Overview:
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier. You'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. 
We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!
### Introduction
The TMDb movie dataset provide many information on all movies. The data contains information that are provided from The Movie Database (TMDb). It collects 5000+ movies basic move information and movie matrices, including user ratings, popularity and revenue data. 
These metrics can be seen as how successful these movies are. The movie basic information contained like cast, director, keywords, runtime, genres, etc.
The primary goal of the project is to go through the general data analysis process â€” using basic data analysis technique with NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. It contains three parts:

Data Wrangling
Exploratory Data Analysis
Conclusion
In this Project I am going to explore following questions :
**Question** 1 (Which years do movies have the Highest budget?)
**Question** 2 (What is the Average Revenue earned by the movies?)
**Question** 3 Top 15 movies by the budget and runtime

#### Final conclusion:
1: at first question,this line chart depicts in which year do movies had the highest budget
it is clearly from the graph that the budget increased gradually from 2006-2013 after that there is a slighty decreased ,
also we can cleary see the movies of 2013 have the highest budget .
2 : at second question ; the total profit is over 13 billions so i found the average of the profit is about 60 millions. which i think
the budget must be around 60 millions for movies to be in successful criteria
3: Thierd question : this bar chart depicts the top 15 movies with the most budget in 100's of million . it is clear from the graph as an aggregate the budget of movies between (2.5-3) but the most budget as we can see was for ( Warrior's Way movie (2010) )
Top 15 movies by runtime
I created a histogram to see the runtime distributions of all the movies and it is clear from the graph 2500 movies have ( 1 hour 40 minutes ) after there are over 1500 movies have about 2 hours runtime .
